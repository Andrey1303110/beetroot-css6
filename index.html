            This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or
            twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to clear
            the way with its cowâ€“catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a
            tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for,
            having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living
            flesh which no dam could contain.

            The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason
            of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please the
            buffaloes to get out of the way.<br />Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to
            discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them.

            "What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they were
            not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And
            here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!"

            <b>&#8220</b> The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was wise.
